# Portfolio Analysis, Asset Pricing and Monte-Carlo Simulations
This is an ongoing project to assess the performance of a portfolio, find optimal weighting of the assets, and price different financial products.

In this project, I am building a framework to 
<ul>
	<li>load stock data from yahoo finance
	<li>plot time series of stock prices, return distributions and Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) diagrams
	<li>check for normality of the distribution of returns
	<li>calculate optimal weights of the portfolio, the efficient frontier, and the Capital Market Line (CML)
	<li>find the tangency portfolio 
	<li>... (work in progress)
</ul>

The second part of this project will be a framework to price different financial products such as different kinds of bonds, or derivative products (e.g. options), and use Monte-Carlo simulation to show expected returns of certain (hedging) strategies using derivatives.
